                        <b><p style="color:black">Convert existing inverter battery setup into a Solar setup using ELASTIC Solar Power Pack.</p></b>
					</header>
                    <p>ELASTIC SOLAR POWER PACK is a smart device, based on patented technology, fully automated which can convert any ordinary  inverter and battery setup into solar    power system. It lets you use the free and green energy   generated by   solar panels to power all your electrical equipment. You make huge savings on electricity bill and get to charge the batteries even during power-cut and of course help save the environment.
<br><br>
                        Convert existing inverter battery setup into a Solar setup using ELASTIC Solar Power Pack

<br><br>
 If you own a UPS/Inverter which is in good condition with a good backup, you can take advantage of Solar by simply installing ELASTIC Solar Power Pack to utilize solar power during the day and save on energy bills.
<br><br>
ELASTIC Solar Power Pack enables the addition of ELASTIC Solar Panels to the existing batteries and Inverter. ELASTIC Solar Power Pack which has a built in converter and charger system, all in one, charges the batteries and intelligently controls the use of grid power.
<br><br>
Your power bills will reduce considerably if your main usage is during daytime. This is a major saving since commercial power is more expensive than residential power.
<br><br>
                        How Does ELASTIC Solar Power Pack work?
<br><br>
ELASTIC Solar Power Pack, which comes with ELASTIC SOLAR PANELS gets  connected to your existing inverter and battery. When sun rays fall on solar panels, they generate power which reaches the batteries through ELASTIC Solar Power Pack and batteries get charged. 
<br>
Pre-loaded Priority Logics with high efficient charge controller helps to reduce power bill. Wall mountable, Sleek Design and a  user friendly LCD displays Solar current generated, status of batteries, the charging status and the load shared.
Specially LED display Lights indicate the working of ELASTIC SOLAR   POWER PACK which gives flexibility to the user, who can observe the working of the system from a distance even.
<br>
Elastic Solar Power Pack has a conversion efficiency >95%. There are click switches to reset LCD and bypass grid if required. The Inverter's AC input plug is connected to ELASTIC Solar Power Pack (A socket is provided for this input) and a cable with 3 pin plug for the Mains input. Once the Solar panel and Battery connections are made, the unit is ready for operation.
<br><br>
ELASTIC Solar Power pack is available in two modes : Super Saver Mode and Standard Mode.
<br><br>
The Super Saver Mode prioritises maximum usage of  the electricity from the solar panels. The Super saver mode used the Solar Power during the day to charge the batteries and also to run the loads throughout the day time.
<br>
In the evening/ night time, Super Saver mode uses the stored battery power to run the loads.  It draws the power from the battery till the individual battery voltage is up to 11.3 V. Thereafter,  the Elastic Solar Power Pack guides the power from the Grid. This is the best Electricity saving option for the areas where Power cuts are very less.
<br><br>
DURING DAY TIME
When batteries are charged to the pre-set level, the ELASTIC Solar Power Pack automatically cuts AC grid power from the load and the load will run through the inverter (using stored battery charge). Hence during day time, the system is designed to give priority to solar power and use grid power only when the solar power is insufficient to charge the batteries or battery charge is insufficient to meet the load requirement.
<br><br>
DURING NIGHT TIME  (FOR STANDARD MODE)
<br>
​The inverter functions like a regular domestic inverter. It stores the electricity of the daytime and if there is a power cut, the inverter can power the load using the charged battery bank.
<br><br>
The ELASTIC Solar Power Pack works intelligently to decide when to charge your inverter from solar or the grid, depending upon the availability of the former.
It also works as a master control to power the household loads depending upon the status of the batteries, solar power available and also availability of main grid.
<br>
 
ELASTIC SOLAR POWER PACK has a Microcontroller based intelligent algorithm for maximum efficiency of solar power.

					</header>
                   <button class="accordion">Solar Power - What is it?</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>The direct conversion of solar energy into electrical energy is called photovoltaics. This term consists of the Greek words "photos" for light and "volta" according to Alessandro Volta, a pioneer of electrical engineering. Solar energy today, just like wind energy, is an integral part of the energy mix in India and many other countries.</p>
</div>
                    
<button class="accordion">Is Solar Power environment friendly?</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>On the one hand, solar power replaces other sources of pollution in the energy mix, such as coal, nuclear fuels, gas or oil. On the other hand, a solar power system avoids many tonnes of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. This makes a solar power system not only independent of rising electricity prices but also contributes to environmental protection.</p>
</div>
                    
<button class="accordion">How is Solar Power harnessed by a PV System?</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>A photovoltaic (PV) solar energy system is composed of solar panels, racking for mounting the panels on the roof, electrical wiring, and an inverter. From sunrise to sunset, the solar panels generate direct current electricity (DC) which is sent to the inverter. The inverter converts the DC into alternating current (AC), the type of electricity required for household use. </p>
</div>

<button class="accordion">What is the life expectancy for Solar Power Systems?</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>A quality module can achieve good power yields for more than 35 years and longer. Many plants have been working flawlessly for decades. Overall, the yield decreases slightly year by year, but long-term studies have shown that even after 20 years, good modules still have an energy yield of well over 80 percent of their rated output. What matters is quality. 
<br>
A solar panel has two warranties: a performance and equipment guarantee. A solar panel’s performance warranty will typically guarantee 90% production at 10 years and 80% at 25 years. An equipment warranty will typically guarantee 10-12 years without failing. <b>ELASTIC</b> offers the best warranties.
<br>
Basically, a solar power system is very disruptive and low-maintenance. Only in the case of the inverters is a replacement usually necessary after approximately 10 years.</p>
</div>
                    <button class="accordion">Do my solar panels produce power when the Sun isn’t shining?</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>The amount of power your solar energy system can generate is dependent on sunlight. As a result, your solar panels will produce slightly less energy when the weather is cloudy, and no energy at night. However, because of high electricity costs and financial incentives, solar is a smart decision even if you live in a cloudy city.</p>
</div>
                          <button class="accordion">Can I go off grid with solar panels?</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>When you install solar panels on your property, you will still be connected to the grid. This allows you to draw from the grid when your system is not producing all of the power that you need, and send power back to the grid when you produce more than you use.</p>
</div>
                          <button class="accordion">Will I still receive an electric bill if I have solar panels?</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>Unless your solar energy system includes battery storage and you are fully off the grid, you will still receive a bill from your utility. However, you can dramatically reduce your bill, or even cut the amount you owe to 0 bucks, with a solar panel system that matches your energy use.</p>
</div>
                          <button class="accordion">What are the financial benefits of solar energy?</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>When you install a solar energy system on your property, you save money on your electricity bills and protect yourself against rising electricity rates in the future. How much you can save depends on the utility rates and solar policies in your area, but going solar is a smart investment regardless of where you live.</p>
</div>
                          <button class="accordion">What size solar energy system should I get?</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>The size of your solar energy system will depend on how much electricity you use on a monthly basis, as well as the weather conditions where you live. Take a look at your past electricity bills and contact +919810118362 / +919810364938 to determine the best system size for your needs.</p>
</div>
                    <button class="accordion">Do I need to install solar batteries with my Elastic Solar Power Pack?</button>
<div class="panel">
