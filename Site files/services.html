                        <h2>Power Generation and Clean Energy Resources</h2>
                        The last 100 years of human civilization has seen more technological progress than the last 5000 - and this has exponentially increased our usage of the resources of our planet. However, we have become victims of our own success, and we now face frightening ecological and economic consequences, due to global warming leading to climate change, pollution and, not the least, exhaustion of non-renewable sources of energy. The need to transition from our current sources of energy such as coal and oil to cleaner and renewable sources of energy are vital to prevent unmanageable exponential price rise while slowing down the harmful effects of global warming. For businesses around the world the key to success will depend upon how the challenges are approached.

                        <b style="color:black;text-align:left;font-size:1.7em;">Energy Sustainability</b><br><br>
                        Energy is a recurring expenditure that can constitute a significant expense for many enterprises. With rising energy costs and shortages of electricity, it is imperative that companies look to becoming more efficient in their use of energy. Additionally, improving sustainability and increasing the mix of renewable energy are now mandated by several companies with global operations. Governments are also making it mandatory for companies to become greener and reduce their carbon foot-print. With major corporations around the world setting up global offices in emerging economies like India and China, where social and national pressure mounting towards rapid economic growth with environmentally responsible business is highly sought, it is not surprising that the 'Green' importance of business is being taken very seriously. A fairly large proportion of global revenues being generated in the emerging markets have ensured that environmental consideration (of which energy is an important component) at an organizational level is closely aligned to the business strategy. Clean Energy makes Business Sense At A. D. GLOBAL SYNERGIES PRIVATE LIMITED, we define the practice of improving energy efficiency through innovation and introducing renewable energy wherever possible as "Clean Energy". Inculcating efficient energy management practices or revisiting internal systems across the enterprise often leads to reduction in costs, new revenue streams and even resulting in innovative business models. The clear brand advantage with customers, investors and employees is over and above the long term benefits an organization will reap with sustainable business practices.</span>

Energy storage like battery technologies, superconducting magnetic energy, capacitors, compressed air and pumped storage, seems to be an alternative method that the operator of an electrical power grid can use to adapt energy production to energy consumption, both of which can vary randomly over time.
Renewables also help the electric power industry maintain a diverse fuel mix for electricity generation. Fuel diversity helps to ensure reliable, affordable electricity for our nation's households and businesses.
